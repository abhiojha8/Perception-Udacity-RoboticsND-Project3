## Project 3: 3D Perception in a Cluttered Space
##### Udacity Robotics Nanodegree
###### October 2017

###
###

### Overview

###### The goal of this project is to program a PR2 to identify and acquire target objects from a cluttered space and place them in a bin. The project is based on the 'Stow Task' portion of Amazon's Robotics Challenge.

##### Specifically, the objectives of this project are to:

**1.** 
###
**2.** Maneuver the PR2
###
**3.** Grasp the object
###
**4.** 
###
**5.** 
###
**6.** Sucessfully place the object in the destination bin

We operate the 6 D.o.F. arm through **ROS Kinetic** (ran through Linux Ubuntu 16.0) and commands are written in **Python**.

The code driving this project and interacting with ROS can be found at `IK_server.py`

*Quick note on naming convention:* `THIS_IS_A_CONSTANT` *and* `thisIsAVariable`

This **README** is broken into the following sections: **Environment Setup, Code Analysis, and Debugging**
